# CI/CD Pipeline for Java Application with Jenkins and DevOps Tools

This project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using Jenkins and various DevOps tools. The pipeline integrates **ngrok** for public exposure of Jenkins, achieving a **50% reduction in deployment time** through enhanced automation and real-time feedback mechanisms. Below is a detailed explanation of the project's orchestration, setup, and workflow.


## Overview
The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, code quality analysis, and deployment processes for a Java-based **Spring Boot** application. By integrating tools like **Jenkins**, **Maven**, **SonarQube**, **Nexus**, and **Slack**, the pipeline ensures consistent builds, high code quality, and rapid deployment. The use of **ngrok** allows secure public access to the Jenkins server, enabling remote monitoring and management. The pipeline reduces deployment time by 50% through parallel execution, automated testing, and real-time developer feedback via Slack.

## Tech Stack
- **Jenkins**: Orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Java**: Programming language for the application (JDK 17).
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for dependency management and build processes.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the Java application.
- **SonarQube**: Static code analysis for code quality and security.
- **Nexus**: Artifact repository for storing build artifacts.
- **Slack**: Real-time notifications for pipeline status.
- **ngrok**: Secure tunneling to expose Jenkins publicly.
- **GitHub**: Version control and source code repository.

## Architecture
The pipeline follows a modular architecture:
1. **Source Code Repository (GitHub)**: Hosts the Spring Boot application code.
2. **Jenkins**: Listens for GitHub webhooks to trigger pipeline execution on code commits.
3. **Maven**: Builds the application, resolves dependencies, and runs unit tests.
4. **SonarQube**: Analyzes code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
5. **Nexus**: Stores build artifacts (e.g., JAR files).
6. **ngrok**: Exposes Jenkins to the internet securely.
7. **Slack**: Sends notifications on build success, failure, or deployment status.
8. **Deployment Environment**: Deploys the application to a target server (e.g., local or cloud-based).

The pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile`, enabling a declarative **pipeline-as-code** approach.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the pipeline, ensure the following:
- **Hardware/VM**: A server with at least 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or compatible Linux distribution).
- **Software**:
  - Java JDK 17
  - Maven 3.8.x
  - Jenkins 2.346.x or later
  - SonarQube 9.x
  - Nexus Repository Manager 3.x
  - ngrok account and authentication token
  - Slack workspace with a webhook for notifications
- **GitHub Repository**: A repository containing the Spring Boot application.
- **Network**: Stable internet connection for ngrok and external tool integrations.
